<br> 
<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 5 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 1, 2** </span>

Good research practice (GRP) is defined as “**the collective ethical criteria on how good research should be conducted**” [(VR, 2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html), and encompasses a range of ethical standards and guidelines that govern the conduct of research across disciplines. Adhering to GRP while conducting research is crucial, as it ensures the credibility and reliability of research findings, fosters the public’s trust in science, upholds the ethical treatment of research subjects, and respects the broader societal impact of scholarly work. Thus, conducting high quality research requires adherence to GRP [(VR, 2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html).

In Sweden, the responsibility of researchers to follow GRP is enshrined in **national legislation**, such as:  

- [Law 2019:504. the Act on Responsibility for Good Research Practice and the Examination of Research Misconduct ('lagen om ansvar för god forskningssed och prövning av oredlighet i forskning')](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)  

Swedish researchers are further expected to adhere to a set of **well-established, non-legally-binding research integrity and ethics guidelines**, most notably:  

- [Good Research Practice ('God Forskningssed')](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html)  
- [The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf)  

and also **documents** such as:  

- [the Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki/)  
- [the Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/default.shtml)

Finally, many research institutions have formulated **codes of conducts** they expect all employees to adhere to, for example:  

- [SciLifeLabs code of conduct](https://www.scilifelab.se/code-of-conduct/)   

**Adhering to GRP as a researcher means not only refraining from violating these laws and guidelines, but also practicing research with a keen awareness of applicable regulations, as well as relying on personal moral judgement.**   

The responsibility for upholding GRP is shared by all actors in research performing organizations. On a higher level, it is up to the research performing organization to create a good research environment, for example by ([SUHF, 2023](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2023/09/REK-2020-3-REV-Vagledning-for-larosatens-arbete-med-att-forebygga-hantera-och-folja-upp-misstankar-om-avvikelser-fran-god-forskningssed-REVIDERAD-2023.pdf)): 

-	Training and mentoring in GRP 
-	Supporting functions (e.g. by producing guidelines)
-	Infrastructure and (technical) support (e.g. by setting up clear procedures)
-	Incentive structures (e.g. by rewarding adherence to GRP) 

It is also the responsibility of the research performing organization to ensure academic freedom for individual researchers, a protection that is enshrined in Swedish law ([Law 1992:1434. The higher education act ('Högskolelag')](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/hogskolelag-19921434_sfs-1992-1434/)). However, this academic freedom comes with the responsibility for individual researchers to uphold research integrity ([Section 4 of Law 2019:504](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)). GRP is not uniform across all fields; ethical considerations and legal requirements may vary depending on the subject area. **It is thus the researchers own responsibility to ensure familiarity with regulations and guidelines, continuously update knowledge when changes occur, and understand how these principles are applied in specific research areas.**   

You as a researcher much have:   
  
-	good knowledge of the framework and starting points for GRP  
-	the ability to apply principles and rules in practice and with regard to various legitimate interests and demands   
-	good professional judgment   
-	good research habits   
-	the ability to resist temptations and undue influence   
-	the ability to handle ethical challenges  

  
*The following chapters will outline how to follow GRP throughout an academic project, from acquiring funding, to the experimental phase, to collaborating (inter)nationally, to publishing and reviewing. The final chapter covers research misconduct and outlines the procedure following a misconduct accusation.*

<summary><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black;">2. GRP in acquiring funding</span></summary>
<br> 
<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 2 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 3** </span>  
  
GRP extends to the **responsible and ethical use of research funding and resources**. Researchers must strive to:  

- maximize the value of research while minimizing waste of time and resources      
- avoid unnecessary harm, risk, or suffering  

Funding applications should clearly demonstrate how the proposed research has the potential to generate valuable knowledge and/or societal benefit. Conducting research with no such potential is inconsistent with GRP.  
    
When applying for grants, such as those offered by e.g. [the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet)](https://www.vr.se), [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en), and [the ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/apply-grant), researchers must reflect on ethical aspects early in the planning phase of their projects. Applications must address both **legal requirements** and **broader ethical considerations**. This includes:  

- identifying potential ethical challenges
- describing how ethical issues will be managed
- describing how compliance with relevant regulations will be ensured
- justifying why the research should be conducted   

See e.g. [VR 'Conducting ethical research'](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/conducting-ethical-research.html), [Horizon Europe 'Ethics self-assessment guide'](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/how-to-complete-your-ethics-self-assessment_en.pdf), and [ERC 'Ethics guidance'](https://erc.europa.eu/manage-your-project/ethics-guidance) for requirements surrounding ethical reflections in grant proposals.   
 
**In summary: adherence to ethical standards in funding applications is essential for fostering trust and accountability in research. By addressing ethical issues transparently and comprehensively, researchers contribute to the responsible use of funding and uphold the integrity of the research process.**

<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 5 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 4, 5** </span> 
<br>  
<details>
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Collaboration with non-academic actors in society</span></summary>   
     
Researchers in a wide variety of fields collaborate with non-academic societal actors to:
   
  - address complex societal challenges    
  - co-create knowledge    
  - develop innovative solutions  
  - ensure that research outcomes have practical applications and tangible benefits for communities, industries, and policymakers  

**These collaborations with societal actors require special attention to ensure**:  

  -	A clear division of responsibilities  
  -	Monitoring how research affects operations of the involved organizations beyond the primary research object  
  -	Sensitivity to power imbalances or conflicts that could affect the research or stakeholders 
</details>     

<details>
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">International collaboration</span></summary>    
  
In addition to collaborating with societal actors, many researchers collaborate internationally to exchange knowledge and/or material. Research conducted across borders requires adherence to regulations of **all involved countries**, as well as a nuanced understanding of cultural, political, and economic differences. In order to ensure **“responsible internationalization”** (see [STINT](https://www.stint.se/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/STINT_Ansvarsfull-internation_web.pdf) for more information), researchers and research performing organizations must: 

1.	Identify and apply relevant ethical principles and regulations for each collaboration, ensuring proper planning in accordance with these standards.  

2.	Avoid so called “ethical dumping”, ensuring research outside Sweden respects Swedish ethical guidelines even when local regulations are more permissive, thereby protecting humans, animals, and the environment.  

3.	Clearly define issues of ownership and responsibility for material (including data), and how participants' intellectual property rights will be protected.  

4.	Establish mechanisms to address conflicts and deviations from good research practice.  

For guidance on ethical issues in international collaborations, the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions (SUHF) has developed a [checklist](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2023/04/SUHF-Checklist-Global-Responsible-Engagement-REC.-2023-4-230411-REVISED.pdf), and researchers are further encouraged to apply the [TRUST code](https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The_TRUST_Code.pdf) to ensure equitable global research partnerships. 

When using genetic resources or traditional knowledge from abroad, compliance with [the Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/default.shtml), [EU Access and Benefit Sharing Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0511), and national laws is mandatory. Researchers must document and verify access under the supplier country's rules, using tools like the [EU DECLARE](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/4ac4da/contentassets/09859c1d752d445ab59f06c0544fe6e0/question-and-answer-users.pdf) platform for due diligence. For more information, see [Naturvårdsverket](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/arter-och-artskydd/genetiska-resurser-nagoyaprotokollet/).   

**All together, these practices foster responsible research that respects global ethical standards and promotes trust across borders.**

<br> 
<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 7 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 6, 7** </span>

<details>
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Writing</span></summary>
The scientific publication is often the primary form in which research results are communicated. Ensuring transparency, honesty, and responsibility in publishing and other forms of scientific communication is thus pivotal.
According to [VR (2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html), GRP in scientific publishing entails:   

-	Presenting data, methods, results and interpretations in an **open, honest, transparent and correct** manner, while meeting the interest in protection and legitimate demands for confidentiality  
-	clearly reporting **study robustness**, assumptions and values, **sources of error** and remaining uncertainties and knowledge gaps   
-	referring and **citing clearly and correctly**, in accordance with the standard that applies to the research area   
-	openly reporting any **conflicts of interest**, financial support and dependencies   
-	preventing the dissemination and use of **incorrect results** or **misleading information**  
</details>  

<details>
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Authorship</span></summary>
During manuscript writing, questions surrounding authorship often cause friction. The [Vancouver recommendations](https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf) provide a framework of criteria on what constitutes a contribution sufficient to warrant co-authorship, namely:

1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND   
2. Drafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved    
  
If AI tools are used to generate text or content, this **must always be disclosed**, and researchers must ensure the reliability of such contributions.  
</details>   
  
<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Journal selection</span></summary>
When approaching journals, researchers should only engage with those that adhere to **rigorous, established peer-review standards**, avoiding those that violate these requirements. Researchers shall also ensure that their work is made accessible to peers and the public **promptly**, however respecting legitimate delays (e.g., patents).  
</details>  

<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Peer review</span></summary>
When reviewing manuscripts from peers, researchers must commit to ethical practices as outlined in the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) [ethical guidelines](https://web.sciedu.ca/images/COPE/Ethical_Guidelines_For_Peer_Reviewers_2.pdf), and must primarily ensure that:   

-	their review is honest  
-	their assessment is well-founded  
-	they report any conflicts of interest  
-	they refrain from participating in both the process and decisions when there is a risk of undue influence  
  
Researchers must also counteract publication bias by ensuring valuable findings are published, regardless of whether results indicate confirmation or rejection of the initial hypothesis.

<summary><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black;">6. Scientific misconduct </span></summary>  
<br> 
<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 15 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 6, 7** </span> 
<br>  
<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Causes of misconduct</span></summary>
Adhering to GRP is vital for **producing credible research, maintaining public trust, ensuring ethical integrity, and practicing societal responsibility**, yet various factors can lead researchers to deviate from the laws, guidelines and principles outlined in chapters 1-5 of this module. Within the scientific community, several elements increase the likelihood that researchers deviate from GRP. An example is the element of **competition** in research, which can pressure researchers to compromise on GRP. In addition, **evaluation systems** that rely heavily on quantitative indicators (e.g., number of publications, citation counts) can incentivize shortcuts. **Understanding these factors contributing to deviations from GRP, and how to mitigate them, is pivotal.** 

In some instances, causes for deviations from GRP can be reasonably unintentional and benign, such as: 

-	Ignorance: Lack of awareness of ethical research practices  
-	Negligence: Carelessness in methodology or reporting  
-	Stress and Pressure: High expectations, deadlines, or resource limitations  
-	Poor Research Habits: Developing methods or attitudes inconsistent with ethical guidelines  

In other more severe cases, researchers might deliberately bypass ethical practices to manipulate outcomes.

The following subchapters will explore various types of GRP breaches and the procedures for addressing suspected misconduct in Sweden.

</details>   

<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Types of misconduct</span></summary>
In section 2 of [Act 2019:504](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/), research misconduct is defined as:  
  
“*a serious deviation from good research practice in the form of fabrication, falsification or plagiarism committed intentionally or through gross negligence in the planning, implementation or reporting of research*”  

The core types of research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP)) are defined as follows:

1.	Fabrication: Creating false data or results and presenting them as real.
2.	Falsification: Manipulating materials, equipment, processes, or data to misrepresent the research. Includes changing, omitting or suppressing data without justification.
3.	Plagiarism: Using another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without proper attribution, thus violating intellectual property rights.
  
While fabrication and falsification always (in principle) constitute serious breaches of GRP and are thus classified as **misconduct**, a minor occurrence of plagiarism might not be considered a serious breach if done unintentional or not through gross negligence. 

In addition to FFP, there are a wide variety of scenarios that constitute smaller breaches of GRP. Below are examples of some (but not all) of these scenarios:   
  
-	Failing to verify sources or data adequately  
-	Conducting insufficient experiments to ensure reliability  
-	Misattributing authorship in publications  
-	Conducting research without the necessary permits or ethical safeguards  
-	Reusing one’s own prior work without proper acknowledgment  
-	Presenting results inaccurately or incompletely  
-	Concealing AI use in content creation  
-	Refusing to share results without valid reasons  
-	Misrepresenting statistical significance  
-	Hindering the research efforts of peers  
  
</details>   
   
<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Procedures for handling suspicions of misconduct</span></summary>

As per [Act 2019:504](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/), suspected misconduct fitting the legal definition (FFP) is handled by the [National Board for the Assessment of Research Misconduct (Npof)](https://npof.se/en/) (Nämnden för prövning av oredlighet i forskning). Cases outside Npof’s jurisdiction (i.e., deviations from GRP that don’t fit the definition of research misconduct) are managed by the researcher’s institution, such as a university, following the [Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100)](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/hogskoleforordning-1993100_sfs-1993-100/) (högskoleförordningen). Institutions are required to establish clear guidelines for such examinations according to [recommendations from SUHF](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2023/09/REK-2020-3-REV-Vagledning-for-larosatens-arbete-med-att-forebygga-hantera-och-folja-upp-misstankar-om-avvikelser-fran-god-forskningssed-REVIDERAD-2023.pdf).   
  
There are three ways in which a report of suspicion of misconduct can be initiated at Npof:

-	Through a submission from a research performing organization
-	Through a direct notification from an individual 
-	on Npofs initiative based on its own observations

The [Act (2021:890) on whistleblower protection](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2021890-om-skydd-for-personer-som_sfs-2021-890/) ensures safeguards for those reporting suspected misconduct. Further guidance is available in the [Whistleblower Protection Handbook](https://zenodo.org/records/8192478).

After a case has been investigated according to [procedure](https://npof.se/en/research-misconduct/provningsprocess-en/) at Npof or a higher education institution, a decision on a deviation from GRP can have various consequences for the researcher, such as: 

- Employment measures:   
  - warnings, salary deductions or dismissal   
- Academic sanctions:   
  - correction or withdrawal of published articles  
  - suspension of grant payments  
  - reclamation of previously received research funding   
  - limitation to the ability of researchers to apply for or receive new grants   
- Legal liability:   
  - reprimands, warnings, injunctions, prohibitions, fines, administrative sanctions
  - imprisonment or fines for criminal offenses (e.g., conducting research without required permits)


In addition, some wider impacts on science and society may be seen, for example: 

- Reduced trust in the research community and public perception of science
- Dissemination of incorrect results and waste of resources
- Harm to people, animals, or the environment due to flawed research outcomes

**All types of research misconduct undermine scientific integrity and trust. Researchers must therefore adhere to ethical standards, avoid intentional or negligent deviations, and maintain transparency and accountability in all aspects of their work.**

<br> 
<span style="color: #A7C947;">**Reading time: 7 min  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Self-test question #: 6, 7** </span> 
<br>  
<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Why Open Science</span></summary>
Openness in science, specifically referring to the practice of **openly sharing methods, protocols, data, results, publications, and educational materials**, can help promote various aspects of GRP by:

- enhancing research quality by encouraging peer review and reducing errors  
- building public trust and accountability in scientific work  
- minimizing publication bias and unnecessary repetition of studies  
- facilitating more effective collaborations and resource utilization  
  
For these reasons, GRP encourages researchers to provide other researchers and the public with as much insight into their work as possible. To ensure respect for and protection of individuals, this approach adheres to the principle of *"as open as possible, as closed as necessary"*.
</details> 

<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">"Allmän handling"</span></summary>
In Sweden, the principle of academic openness is enshrined in [law 1949:105](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/tryckfrihetsforordning-1949105_sfs-1949-105/) (the Freedom of the Press Ordinance (‘tryckfrihetsförordning’)), which dictates **the public’s (‘allmänhetens’) right to transparency**. In practice this means that **everyone** has the right to access public documents (‘allmänna handlingar’) which are not classified as confidential. ‘Public documents’ are all documents that are received by or prepared at a public authority (e.g. a university, college, or other governmental agency) and stored there.  
  
Anyone who requests access to a public document has the right to remain **anonymous** and does not usually have to state **what the document or information will be used for**. If access to a public document is denied by a public authority, individuals can demand a written decision from the authority and appeal it to the Court of Appeal (‘Hovrätt’). The right to access public documents can only be limited by the [Public Access and Secrecy Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/offentlighets-och-sekretesslag-2009400_sfs-2009-400/) (2009:400 ‘offentlighets- och sekretesslag’).
Under the [Archives Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/arkivlag-1990782_sfs-1990-782/) (1990:782 'arkivlag'), research materials classified as public documents must be preserved, organized, and maintained to support public insight, judicial processes, and further research.
</details> 

<details> 
<summary><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #491F53;">Data sharing</span></summary>
Data sharing is integral to open science, with the aim of making research data as accessible and reusable as possible. In Sweden, a recent law ([Act 2022:818 on the public sector's access to data](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2022818-om-den-offentliga-sektorns_sfs-2022-818/) ('om den offentliga sektorns tillgängliggörande av data')) encourages the public sector to make research data openly available. 

When sharing data, researchers should follow the FAIR principles:   
    **F**indable  
    **A**ccessible  
    **I**nteroperable  
    **R**eusable  
      
The Swedish Research council has developed [guidelines](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data/support-and-tools-/making-research-data-accessible-and-fair.html) for FAIR data management, as well as a [template](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/producing-a-data-management-plan.html) for the creation of data management plans. 

When sharing data, researchers must be mindful that **openness must always be balanced against the need for protection**, especially regarding sensitive data. Law [2009:400](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/offentlighets-och-sekretesslag-2009400_sfs-2009-400) limits how universities and other authorities can share information to ensure confidentiality, which means, among other things, that researchers must manage research information to **minimize risks** and **comply with applicable rules**, and carefully weigh the value of making the information available (the interest in transparency) against the risks (the interest in protection).

When full openness is not possible, GRP describes alternative approaches:  

- Sharing only the data’s metadata 
- Sharing partial data sets
