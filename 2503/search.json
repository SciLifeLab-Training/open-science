    "text": "Course content\nThe 1hp training ‘Open Science in the Swedish context’ is designed to equip scientists within the DDLS research school with a range of tools needed to perform research in accordance with Swedish Open Science standards, in addition to raising awareness around the Open Science and FAIR principles and how to implement these in a researcher’s daily life. The training covers how to implement Open Science across several stages of the research project lifecycle, including experimental planning & design, sharing & disseminating output, researcher evaluation, and science communication. Through interactive lectures, discussions with guest speakers, and practical assignments, participants will gain first-hand experience with implementing and navigating pre-registration, the Open Access publishing landscape, new researcher evaluation criteria, and citizen science. Completing this training will position scientists within the DDLS research school as future leaders in the global shift towards more open and collaborative research practices, and will support Sweden’s commitment to innovation and public engagement, fostering a research environment where knowledge is freely exchanged and built upon."
