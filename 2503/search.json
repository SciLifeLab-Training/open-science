    "text": "About\n\n\n\nThis module is primarily based on Good Research Practice (‘God forskningssed’, VR, 2024) and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (ALLEA, 2023). The information provided in this module is not exhaustive, but rather meant as an introduction to the topic. Students are encouraged to further examine references to relevant laws and documents.\nUpon completion of this module, students will be able to\n- Demonstrate an understanding of ethical principles and legal frameworks governing research in Sweden\n- Execute every facet of an academic project according to Good Research Practice\nMode of study: self-paced\nPlease work through the sections below and answer the questions in the Google form to test your knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction to Good Research Practice\n\n Reading time: 5 min                                    Self-test question #: 1, 2 \nGood research practice (GRP) is defined as “the collective ethical criteria on how good research should be conducted” (VR, 2024), and encompasses a range of ethical standards and guidelines that govern the conduct of research across disciplines. Adhering to GRP while conducting research is crucial, as it ensures the credibility and reliability of research findings, fosters the public’s trust in science, upholds the ethical treatment of research subjects, and respects the broader societal impact of scholarly work. Thus, conducting high quality research requires adherence to GRP (VR, 2024).\nIn Sweden, the responsibility of researchers to follow GRP is enshrined in national legislation, such as:\n\nLaw 2019:504. the Act on Responsibility for Good Research Practice and the Examination of Research Misconduct (‘lagen om ansvar för god forskningssed och prövning av oredlighet i forskning’)\n\nSwedish researchers are further expected to adhere to a set of well-established, non-legally-binding research integrity and ethics guidelines, most notably:\n\nGood Research Practice (‘God Forskningssed’)\n\nThe European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\n\nand also documents such as:\n\nthe Declaration of Helsinki\n\nthe Nagoya Protocol\n\nFinally, many research institutions have formulated codes of conducts they expect all employees to adhere to, for example:\n\nSciLifeLabs code of conduct\n\nAdhering to GRP as a researcher means not only refraining from violating these laws and guidelines, but also practicing research with a keen awareness of applicable regulations, as well as relying on personal moral judgement.\nThe responsibility for upholding GRP is shared by all actors in research performing organizations. On a higher level, it is up to the research performing organization to create a good research environment, for example by (SUHF, 2023):\n\nTraining and mentoring in GRP\nSupporting functions (e.g. by producing guidelines)\nInfrastructure and (technical) support (e.g. by setting up clear procedures)\nIncentive structures (e.g. by rewarding adherence to GRP)\n\nIt is also the responsibility of the research performing organization to ensure academic freedom for individual researchers, a protection that is enshrined in Swedish law (Law 1992:1434. The higher education act (‘Högskolelag’)). However, this academic freedom comes with the responsibility for individual researchers to uphold research integrity (Section 4 of Law 2019:504). GRP is not uniform across all fields; ethical considerations and legal requirements may vary depending on the subject area. It is thus the researchers own responsibility to ensure familiarity with regulations and guidelines, continuously update knowledge when changes occur, and understand how these principles are applied in specific research areas.\nYou as a researcher much have:\n\ngood knowledge of the framework and starting points for GRP\n\nthe ability to apply principles and rules in practice and with regard to various legitimate interests and demands\n\ngood professional judgment\n\ngood research habits\n\nthe ability to resist temptations and undue influence\n\nthe ability to handle ethical challenges\n\nThe following chapters will outline how to follow GRP throughout an academic project, from acquiring funding, to the experimental phase, to collaborating (inter)nationally, to publishing and reviewing. The final chapter covers research misconduct and outlines the procedure following a misconduct accusation.\n\n\n\n\n2. GRP in acquiring funding\n\n Reading time: 2 min                                    Self-test question #: 3 \nGRP extends to the responsible and ethical use of research funding and resources. Researchers must strive to:\n\nmaximize the value of research while minimizing waste of time and resources\n\navoid unnecessary harm, risk, or suffering\n\nFunding applications should clearly demonstrate how the proposed research has the potential to generate valuable knowledge and/or societal benefit. Conducting research with no such potential is inconsistent with GRP.\nWhen applying for grants, such as those offered by e.g. the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), Horizon Europe, and the ERC, researchers must reflect on ethical aspects early in the planning phase of their projects. Applications must address both legal requirements and broader ethical considerations. This includes:\n\nidentifying potential ethical challenges\ndescribing how ethical issues will be managed\ndescribing how compliance with relevant regulations will be ensured\njustifying why the research should be conducted\n\nSee e.g. VR ‘Conducting ethical research’, Horizon Europe ‘Ethics self-assessment guide’, and ERC ‘Ethics guidance’ for requirements surrounding ethical reflections in grant proposals.\nIn summary: adherence to ethical standards in funding applications is essential for fostering trust and accountability in research. By addressing ethical issues transparently and comprehensively, researchers contribute to the responsible use of funding and uphold the integrity of the research process.\n\n\n\n\n3. GRP in experimental research \n\n Coming soon \n\n\n\n\n4. GRP in (inter)national collaboration \n\n Reading time: 5 min                                    Self-test question #: 4, 5  \n\n\n\nCollaboration with non-academic actors in society\n\nResearchers in a wide variety of fields collaborate with non-academic societal actors to:\n\naddress complex societal challenges\n\nco-create knowledge\n\ndevelop innovative solutions\n\nensure that research outcomes have practical applications and tangible benefits for communities, industries, and policymakers\n\nThese collaborations with societal actors require special attention to ensure:\n\nA clear division of responsibilities\n\nMonitoring how research affects operations of the involved organizations beyond the primary research object\n\nSensitivity to power imbalances or conflicts that could affect the research or stakeholders\n\n\n\n\nInternational collaboration\n\nIn addition to collaborating with societal actors, many researchers collaborate internationally to exchange knowledge and/or material. Research conducted across borders requires adherence to regulations of all involved countries, as well as a nuanced understanding of cultural, political, and economic differences. In order to ensure “responsible internationalization” (see STINT for more information), researchers and research performing organizations must:\n\nIdentify and apply relevant ethical principles and regulations for each collaboration, ensuring proper planning in accordance with these standards.\nAvoid so called “ethical dumping”, ensuring research outside Sweden respects Swedish ethical guidelines even when local regulations are more permissive, thereby protecting humans, animals, and the environment.\nClearly define issues of ownership and responsibility for material (including data), and how participants’ intellectual property rights will be protected.\nEstablish mechanisms to address conflicts and deviations from good research practice.\n\nFor guidance on ethical issues in international collaborations, the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions (SUHF) has developed a checklist, and researchers are further encouraged to apply the TRUST code to ensure equitable global research partnerships.\nWhen using genetic resources or traditional knowledge from abroad, compliance with the Nagoya Protocol, EU Access and Benefit Sharing Regulation, and national laws is mandatory. Researchers must document and verify access under the supplier country’s rules, using tools like the EU DECLARE platform for due diligence. For more information, see Naturvårdsverket.\nAll together, these practices foster responsible research that respects global ethical standards and promotes trust across borders.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. GRP in publishing and reviewing \n\n Reading time: 7 min                                    Self-test question #: 6, 7  \n\n\n\nWriting\n\nThe scientific publication is often the primary form in which research results are communicated. Ensuring transparency, honesty, and responsibility in publishing and other forms of scientific communication is thus pivotal. According to VR (2024), GRP in scientific publishing entails:\n\nPresenting data, methods, results and interpretations in an open, honest, transparent and correct manner, while meeting the interest in protection and legitimate demands for confidentiality\n\nclearly reporting study robustness, assumptions and values, sources of error and remaining uncertainties and knowledge gaps\n\nreferring and citing clearly and correctly, in accordance with the standard that applies to the research area\n\nopenly reporting any conflicts of interest, financial support and dependencies\n\npreventing the dissemination and use of incorrect results or misleading information\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship\n\nDuring manuscript writing, questions surrounding authorship often cause friction. The Vancouver recommendations provide a framework of criteria on what constitutes a contribution sufficient to warrant co-authorship, namely:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND\n\nDrafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND\n\nFinal approval of the version to be published; AND\n\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved\n\nIf AI tools are used to generate text or content, this must always be disclosed, and researchers must ensure the reliability of such contributions.\n\n\n\nJournal selection\n\nWhen approaching journals, researchers should only engage with those that adhere to rigorous, established peer-review standards, avoiding those that violate these requirements. Researchers shall also ensure that their work is made accessible to peers and the public promptly, however respecting legitimate delays (e.g., patents).\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nWhen reviewing manuscripts from peers, researchers must commit to ethical practices as outlined in the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) ethical guidelines, and must primarily ensure that:\n\ntheir review is honest\n\ntheir assessment is well-founded\n\nthey report any conflicts of interest\n\nthey refrain from participating in both the process and decisions when there is a risk of undue influence\n\nResearchers must also counteract publication bias by ensuring valuable findings are published, regardless of whether results indicate confirmation or rejection of the initial hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Scientific misconduct \n\n Reading time: 15 min                                    Self-test question #: 6, 7  \n\n\n\nCauses of misconduct\n\nAdhering to GRP is vital for producing credible research, maintaining public trust, ensuring ethical integrity, and practicing societal responsibility, yet various factors can lead researchers to deviate from the laws, guidelines and principles outlined in chapters 1-5 of this module. Within the scientific community, several elements increase the likelihood that researchers deviate from GRP. An example is the element of competition in research, which can pressure researchers to compromise on GRP. In addition, evaluation systems that rely heavily on quantitative indicators (e.g., number of publications, citation counts) can incentivize shortcuts. Understanding these factors contributing to deviations from GRP, and how to mitigate them, is pivotal.\nIn some instances, causes for deviations from GRP can be reasonably unintentional and benign, such as:\n\nIgnorance: Lack of awareness of ethical research practices\n\nNegligence: Carelessness in methodology or reporting\n\nStress and Pressure: High expectations, deadlines, or resource limitations\n\nPoor Research Habits: Developing methods or attitudes inconsistent with ethical guidelines\n\nIn other more severe cases, researchers might deliberately bypass ethical practices to manipulate outcomes.\nThe following subchapters will explore various types of GRP breaches and the procedures for addressing suspected misconduct in Sweden.\n\n\n\nTypes of misconduct\n\nIn section 2 of Act 2019:504, research misconduct is defined as:\n“a serious deviation from good research practice in the form of fabrication, falsification or plagiarism committed intentionally or through gross negligence in the planning, implementation or reporting of research”\nThe core types of research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP)) are defined as follows:\n\nFabrication: Creating false data or results and presenting them as real.\nFalsification: Manipulating materials, equipment, processes, or data to misrepresent the research. Includes changing, omitting or suppressing data without justification.\nPlagiarism: Using another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without proper attribution, thus violating intellectual property rights.\n\nWhile fabrication and falsification always (in principle) constitute serious breaches of GRP and are thus classified as misconduct, a minor occurrence of plagiarism might not be considered a serious breach if done unintentional or not through gross negligence.\nIn addition to FFP, there are a wide variety of scenarios that constitute smaller breaches of GRP. Below are examples of some (but not all) of these scenarios:\n\nFailing to verify sources or data adequately\n\nConducting insufficient experiments to ensure reliability\n\nMisattributing authorship in publications\n\nConducting research without the necessary permits or ethical safeguards\n\nReusing one’s own prior work without proper acknowledgment\n\nPresenting results inaccurately or incompletely\n\nConcealing AI use in content creation\n\nRefusing to share results without valid reasons\n\nMisrepresenting statistical significance\n\nHindering the research efforts of peers\n\n\n\n\nProcedures for handling suspicions of misconduct\n\nAs per Act 2019:504, suspected misconduct fitting the legal definition (FFP) is handled by the National Board for the Assessment of Research Misconduct (Npof) (Nämnden för prövning av oredlighet i forskning). Cases outside Npof’s jurisdiction (i.e., deviations from GRP that don’t fit the definition of research misconduct) are managed by the researcher’s institution, such as a university, following the Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100) (högskoleförordningen). Institutions are required to establish clear guidelines for such examinations according to recommendations from SUHF.\nThere are three ways in which a report of suspicion of misconduct can be initiated at Npof:\n\nThrough a submission from a research performing organization\nThrough a direct notification from an individual\non Npofs initiative based on its own observations\n\nThe Act (2021:890) on whistleblower protection ensures safeguards for those reporting suspected misconduct. Further guidance is available in the Whistleblower Protection Handbook.\nAfter a case has been investigated according to procedure at Npof or a higher education institution, a decision on a deviation from GRP can have various consequences for the researcher, such as:\n\nEmployment measures:\n\nwarnings, salary deductions or dismissal\n\n\nAcademic sanctions:\n\ncorrection or withdrawal of published articles\n\nsuspension of grant payments\n\nreclamation of previously received research funding\n\nlimitation to the ability of researchers to apply for or receive new grants\n\n\nLegal liability:\n\nreprimands, warnings, injunctions, prohibitions, fines, administrative sanctions\nimprisonment or fines for criminal offenses (e.g., conducting research without required permits)\n\n\nIn addition, some wider impacts on science and society may be seen, for example:\n\nReduced trust in the research community and public perception of science\nDissemination of incorrect results and waste of resources\nHarm to people, animals, or the environment due to flawed research outcomes\n\nAll types of research misconduct undermine scientific integrity and trust. Researchers must therefore adhere to ethical standards, avoid intentional or negligent deviations, and maintain transparency and accountability in all aspects of their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. GRP and Open Science \n\n Reading time: 7 min                                    Self-test question #: 6, 7  \n\n\n\nWhy Open Science\n\nOpenness in science, specifically referring to the practice of openly sharing methods, protocols, data, results, publications, and educational materials, can help promote various aspects of GRP by:\n\nenhancing research quality by encouraging peer review and reducing errors\n\nbuilding public trust and accountability in scientific work\n\nminimizing publication bias and unnecessary repetition of studies\n\nfacilitating more effective collaborations and resource utilization\n\nFor these reasons, GRP encourages researchers to provide other researchers and the public with as much insight into their work as possible. To ensure respect for and protection of individuals, this approach adheres to the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.\n\n\n\n“Allmän handling”\n\nIn Sweden, the principle of academic openness is enshrined in law 1949:105 (the Freedom of the Press Ordinance (‘tryckfrihetsförordning’)), which dictates the public’s (‘allmänhetens’) right to transparency. In practice this means that everyone has the right to access public documents (‘allmänna handlingar’) which are not classified as confidential. ‘Public documents’ are all documents that are received by or prepared at a public authority (e.g. a university, college, or other governmental agency) and stored there.\nAnyone who requests access to a public document has the right to remain anonymous and does not usually have to state what the document or information will be used for. If access to a public document is denied by a public authority, individuals can demand a written decision from the authority and appeal it to the Court of Appeal (‘Hovrätt’). The right to access public documents can only be limited by the Public Access and Secrecy Act (2009:400 ‘offentlighets- och sekretesslag’). Under the Archives Act (1990:782 ‘arkivlag’), research materials classified as public documents must be preserved, organized, and maintained to support public insight, judicial processes, and further research.\n\n\n\nData sharing\n\nData sharing is integral to open science, with the aim of making research data as accessible and reusable as possible. In Sweden, a recent law (Act 2022:818 on the public sector’s access to data (‘om den offentliga sektorns tillgängliggörande av data’)) encourages the public sector to make research data openly available.\nWhen sharing data, researchers should follow the FAIR principles:\nFindable\nAccessible\nInteroperable\nReusable\nThe Swedish Research council has developed guidelines for FAIR data management, as well as a template for the creation of data management plans.\nWhen sharing data, researchers must be mindful that openness must always be balanced against the need for protection, especially regarding sensitive data. Law 2009:400 limits how universities and other authorities can share information to ensure confidentiality, which means, among other things, that researchers must manage research information to minimize risks and comply with applicable rules, and carefully weigh the value of making the information available (the interest in transparency) against the risks (the interest in protection).\nWhen full openness is not possible, GRP describes alternative approaches:\n\nSharing only the data’s metadata\nSharing partial data sets\nSharing only the data’s public information, omitting the confidential part\n\nInformation that is deemed confidential should be stored securely for release upon request, after confidentiality review if required.\nOther data that do not fall under law 2002:818 include data covered by sole rights, for example according to patent legislation (1967:837 Patent law), or that a third party has rights over according to copyright legislation (1960:729 on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works).\nBy embracing openness within the framework of good research practice, researchers can foster trust, ensure ethical responsibility, and contribute to scientific progress while safeguarding sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nLaws\n\n2019:504. the Act on Responsibility for Good Research Practice and the Examination of Research Misconduct ‘lagen 2019:504 om ansvar för god forskningssed och prövning av oredlighet i forskning’, Utbildningsdepartement, 2019\n\n1992:1434.
