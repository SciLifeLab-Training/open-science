    "text": "Module details\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes Familiarize researchers in the SciLifeLab DDLS program with the most important aspects of Good Research Practice, specifically in the Swedish context\nMode of study: self-paced\nLicensing: This module is heavily based on Good Research Practice (‘God forskningssed’, VR, 2024) and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (ALLEA, 2023)\nThe information provided in this module is not exhaustive, but rather meant as an introduction to the topic. Students are encouraged to further examine references to laws and documents relevant to their specific research projects.\nPlease work through the sections below and answer the questions in the Google form to test your knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction to Good Research Practice\n\n Reading time: 10 min                                    Self-test questions: 2 \nGood research practice (GRP) is defined as “the collective ethical criteria on how good research should be conducted” (VR, 2017), and encompasses a range of ethical standards and guidelines that govern the conduct of research across disciplines. Adhering to GRP while conducting research is crucial, as it ensures the credibility and reliability of research findings, fosters the public’s trust in science, upholds the ethical treatment of research subjects, and respects the broader societal impact of scholarly work. Thus, conducting high quality research requires adherence to GRP (VR, 2017).\nIn Sweden, the responsibility of researchers to follow GRP is enshrined in national legislation, such as:\n\nLaw 2019:504. the Act on Responsibility for Good Research Practice and the Examination of Research Misconduct (‘lagen om ansvar för god forskningssed och prövning av oredlighet i forskning’)\n\nSwedish researchers are further expected to adhere to a set of well-established, non-legally-binding research integrity and ethics guidelines, most notably:\n\nGood Research Practice (‘God Forskningssed’)\n\nThe European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\n\nand also documents such as:\n\nthe Declaration of Helsinki\n\nthe Nagoya Protocol\n\nFinally, many research institutions have formulated codes of conducts they expect all employees to adhere to, for example:\n\nSciLifeLabs code of conduct\n\nAdhering to GRP as a researcher means not only refraining from violating these laws and guidelines, but also practicing research with a keen awareness of applicable regulations, as well as relying on personal moral judgement.\nThe responsibility for upholding GRP is shared by all actors in research performing organizations. On a higher level, it is up to the research performing organization to create a good research environment, for example by (SUHF, 2023):\n\nTraining and mentoring in GRP\nSupporting functions (e.g. guidelines)\nInfrastructure and (technical) support (e.g. clear procedures)\nIncentive structures\n\nIt is also the responsibility of the research performing organization to ensure academic freedom for individual researchers, a protection that is enshrined in Swedish law (Law 1992:1434. The higher education act (‘Högskolelag’)). However, this academic freedom comes with the responsibility for individual researchers to uphold research integrity (Section 4 of Law 2019:504). GRP is not uniform across all fields; ethical considerations and legal requirements may vary depending on the subject area. It is thus the researchers own responsibility to ensure familiarity with regulations and guidelines, continuously update knowledge when changes occur, and understand how these principles are applied in specific research areas.\nYou as a researcher much have:\n\ngood knowledge of the framework and starting points for GRP\n\nthe ability to apply principles and rules in practice and with regard to various legitimate interests and demands\n\ngood professional judgment\n\ngood research habits\n\nthe ability to resist temptations and undue influence\n\nthe ability to handle ethical challenges\n\nThe following chapters will outline how to follow GRP throughout a scholarly investigation, from acquiring funding, to the experimental phase, to collaborating (inter)nationally, to publishing and reviewing. Also contain an overview research misconduct and the procedure for those accused.\n\n\n\n\n2. GRP in acquiring funding\n\n Reading time: 3 min                                    Self-test questions: 1 \nGRP extends to the responsible and ethical use of research funding and resources. Researchers must strive to:\n\nmaximize the value of research while minimizing waste of time and resources\n\navoid unnecessary harm, risk, or suffering\n\nFunding applications should clearly demonstrate how the proposed research has the potential to generate valuable knowledge and/or societal benefit. Conducting research with no such potential is inconsistent with GRP.\nWhen applying for grants, such as those offered by e.g. the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), Horizon Europe, and the ERC, researchers must reflect on ethical aspects early in the planning phase of their projects. Applications must address both legal requirements and broader ethical considerations. This includes:\n\nidentifying potential ethical challenges\ndescribing how ethical issues will be managed\ndescribing how compliance with relevant regulations will be ensured\njustifying why the research should be conducted\n\nSee e.g. VR, Horizon Europe, and ERC for requirements surrounding ethical reflections in grant proposals.\nAdhering to ethical standards in funding applications is thus essential for fostering trust and accountability in research. By addressing ethical issues transparently and comprehensively, researchers contribute to the responsible use of funding and uphold the integrity of the research process.\n\n\n\n\n3. GRP in experimental research \n\n Coming soon \n\n\n\n\n4. GRP in (inter)national collaboration \n\n\nCollaboration with non-academic actors in society\nResearchers in a wide variety of fields collaborate with non-academic societal actors to address complex societal challenges, co-create knowledge, develop innovative solutions, and ensure that research outcomes have practical applications and tangible benefits for communities, industries, and policymakers. These collaborations with societal actors require special attention to ensure:\n- A clear division of responsibilities\n- Monitoring how research affects operations of the involved organizations beyond the primary research object\n- Sensitivity to power imbalances or conflicts that could affect the research or stakeholders\n\n\nInternational collaboration\nIn addition to collaborating with societal actors, many researchers collaborate internationally to exchange knowledge and/or material. Research conducted across borders requires adherence to regulations of all involved countries, as well as a nuanced understanding of cultural, political, and economic differences. In order to ensure “responsible internationalization”, researchers and research performing organizations must: \n\nIdentify and apply relevant ethical principles and regulations for each collaboration, ensuring proper planning in accordance with these standards.\nAvoid so called “ethical dumping”, ensuring research outside Sweden respects Swedish ethical guidelines even when local regulations are more permissive (TRUST Code, 2023), thereby protecting humans, animals, and the environment.\nClearly define issues of ownership and responsibility for material (including data), and how participants’ intellectual property rights will be protected.\nEstablish mechanisms to address conflicts and deviations from good research practice.\n\nWhen using genetic resources or traditional knowledge from abroad, compliance with the Nagoya Protocol, EU ABS Regulation (EU Access and Benefit Sharing Regulation 511/2014), and national laws is mandatory. Researchers must document and verify access under the supplier country’s rules, using tools like the EU DECLARE platform for due diligence. These practices foster responsible research that respects global ethical standards and promotes trust across borders.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. GRP in publishing and reviewing \n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\nThe scientific publication is often the primary form in which research results are communicated. Ensuring transparency, honesty, and responsibility in publishing and other forms of scientific communication is thus pivotal. According to VR (2017), GRP in scientific publishing entails: - Presenting data, methods, results and interpretations in an open, honest, transparent and correct manner, while meeting the interest in protection and legitimate demands for confidentiality - clearly reporting study robustness, assumptions and values, sources of error and remaining uncertainties and knowledge gaps - referring and citing clearly and correctly, in accordance with the standard that applies to the research area - openly reporting any conflicts of interest, financial support and dependencies - preventing the dissemination and use of incorrect results or misleading information.\n\n\n\nAuthorship\n\nDuring manuscript writing, questions surrounding authorship often cause friction. The Vancouver Rules (https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf) provide a framework of criteria on what constitutes a contribution sufficient to warrant co-authorship. The ALLEA code also provides authorship criteria, namely: 1. significant contribution to the design of the research, relevant data collection, analysis and/or interpretation of the results 2. writing and/or critical review of the publication 3. approval of the final publication 4. accepting responsibility for the content of the publication, unless otherwise stated in the publication If AI tools are used to generate text or content, this must always be disclosed, and researchers must ensure the reliability of such contributions.\n\n\n\nJournal selection\n\nWhen approaching journals, researchers should only engage with those that adhere to rigorous, established peer-review standards, avoiding those that violate these requirements. Researchers shall also ensure that their work is made accessible to peers and the public promptly, however respecting legitimate delays (e.g., patents).\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nWhen reviewing manuscripts from peers, researchers must commit to ethical practices as outlined in the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) ethical guidelines (https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/ethical-guidelines-peer-reviewers), and must primarily ensure that (VR): - their review is honest - their assessment is well-founded - they report any conflicts of interest - they refrain from participating in both the process and decisions when there is a risk of undue influence. Researchers must also counteract publication bias by ensuring valuable findings are published, regardless of whether results indicate confirmation or rejection of the initial hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.
