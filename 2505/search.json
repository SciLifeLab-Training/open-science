    "text": "Course content\nIn accordance with the international EUA Agenda for Open Science 2025, Sweden has now committed itself to implement Open Science into its higher education by 2026, with clear paths mapped by SUHFs ‘Färdplan för öppen vetenskap’ (2021), and KBs ‘Nationella riktlinjer för öppen vetenskap’ (2024). The 3hp training ‘Open Science in the Swedish context’ is designed to not only raise awareness around the state of Open Science in Sweden, but also to equip academics across all disciplines with a range of tools needed to implement Open Science practices into every step of their research project lifecycle. In this interactive, hands-on course, participants will learn about Open Science through interactive lectures, discussions with guest speakers, and practical assignments. Participants will gain first-hand experience with implementing Open Science practices into experimental planning & design, data collection & analysis, sharing & disseminating research output, long-term data accessibility & re-use, and project & researcher evaluation. Completing this training will position participants as future leaders in the global shift towards more open and collaborative research practices, and will support Sweden’s commitment to innovation and public engagement, fostering a research environment where knowledge is freely exchanged and built upon.\nTopics covered will include:\n\nOpen Science: what’s in it for you?\nThe state of Open Science in Sweden\nEliminating publication bias: how to publish a registered report\nData reuse with the help of data repositories\nGood research practice in Sweden\nNew ways of academic publishing: Open Access and beyond\nGetting credit for all your research outputs: DOIs and licensing\nAdvances in researcher evaluation: funder and institutional perspectives\nScience communication and citizen science\n\nNote: The course is highly interactive and hence it is important that you, as a participant, actively contribute to all sessions and elements of the course. Participants need to bring a laptop.\nDue to limited space the course can accommodate a maximum of 25 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on selection criteria: Priority will be given to applicants from SciLifeLab infrastructures, institutes and organizations across the Nordic research community, and to participants from Nordic ELIXIR nodes."
