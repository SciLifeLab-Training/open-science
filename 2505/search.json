In this interactive, hands-on course, participants will learn about Open Science through interactive lectures, discussions with guest speakers, and practical assignments. Participants will gain first-hand experience with implementing Open Science practices into experimental planning & design, data collection & analysis, sharing & disseminating research output, long-term data accessibility & re-use, and project & researcher evaluation.\nCompleting this training will position participants as future leaders in the global shift towards more open and collaborative research practices, fostering a research environment where knowledge is freely exchanged and built upon.\nTopics covered include:\n\nOpen Science: what’s in it for you?\nThe state of Open Science in Sweden\nEliminating publication bias: how to publish a registered report\nData reuse with the help of data repositories\nGood research practice in Sweden\nNew ways of academic publishing: Open Access and beyond\nGetting credit for all your research outputs: DOIs and licensing\nAdvances in researcher evaluation: funder and institutional perspectives\nScience communication and citizen science"
