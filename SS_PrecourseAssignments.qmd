## Introduction   
Open science is a [global movement](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about?hub=686) that seeks to make scientific research, data, and knowledge openly accessible to everyone. It promotes **transparency, collaboration, and the free exchange of ideas**, thereby not only allowing researchers to build on each other’s work more efficiently and accelerating innovation, but also improving the reproducibility and integrity of research.   
    
In Sweden, the development of Open Science practices has been a key focus for the government, research institutions, and research funders in recent years. In 2017, Sweden's goverment mandated The Royal Library (Kungliga Biblioteket, KB) to coordinate efforts in bringing about open access to research publications. The Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet, VR) received a corresponding mandate for open access to research data. These initiatives have set the foundation for further implementation of Open Science practices into Swedish higher education.

Currently, the transition to Open Science is still very much ongoing in Sweden. To provide support and guidance in this process, KB has developed the [National Guidelines for Open Science](https://www.kb.se/samverkan-och-utveckling/nytt-fran-kb/nyheter-samverkan-och-utveckling/2024-08-27-national-guidelines-for-open-science---now-in-english.html), in which areas within Open Science that are prioritised and crucial to develop fully in Sweden are highlighted. These areas are:  
  
- Open access to scholarly publications  
- Open access to research data  
- Open research methods  
- Open educational resources  
- Public engagement in science  
- Infrastructures supporting open science  
  

During the in-person workshop on March 20th, Module 1 will focus on the state of Open Science in Sweden, and in particular on the National Guidelines for Open Science. This pre-course assignment is developed to familiarize students with the guidelines ahead of the workshop. 
  
  
    
## Assignment  
  
### Step 1: 
Please open the document made available to you via a link you've received per email and add your name to the topic you are most interested in. There are 2 groups for each topic and every group can consist of a maximum of 5 people. Topics are available on a first come, first serve basis.  
 
### Step 2:  
Read the sections of the *National Guidelines for Open Science* relevant to your chosen group. The Guidelines can be accessed [here](https://www.kb.se/samverkan-och-utveckling/nytt-fran-kb/nyheter-samverkan-och-utveckling/2024-08-27-national-guidelines-for-open-science---now-in-english.html) by clicking 'Read the national guidelines for open science'.   

Sections to read per group are as follows:   
- Groups 1.1 & 2.1: pages 8-10, the heading 'Open Access to scholarly publications'  
- Groups 1.2 & 2.2: pages 10-11, the heading 'Open Access to research data'  
- Groups 1.3 & 2.3: pages 11-12, the heading 'Open research methods'  
- Groups 1.4 & 2.4: pages 12-13, the heading 'Open Educational Resources'  
- Groups 1.5 & 2.5: pages 13-15, the heading 'Public engagement in science'  
- Groups 1.6 & 2.6: pages 15-16, the heading 'Infrastructures supporting Open Science'

## Introduction

Open Access publishing is the widely adopted ideal that all should have equitable access to the information generated by research.

There are six different types of OA publishing currently recognized. Below is an overview of the different types.

To prepare for the in-person workshop, listen to the following discussion between researchers, journal editors, and EMBO Open Science professionals on publishing, the move to more Open Access, and the future of journal articles:
